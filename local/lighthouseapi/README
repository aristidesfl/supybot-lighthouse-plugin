A Python interface to the Lighthouse bug tracking API.

The Lighthouse API is a REST'ful XML API that lets you read and write
nearly every object in your Lighthouse project.  The specification is
here:

-----------------------------------------------------
Requires: 
  * Python 2.4 - Because I am using a decorator ;)
  * dateutil - http://labix.org/python-dateutil

Installing:

  *Currently I am just symlinking lighthouse.py and xmltodict.py into my 
   PYTHONPATH.  Until I have an installer or something you should do the same.
